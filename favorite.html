	<h1>Who am I?????</h1>
	<h2>I like to introduce you about myself. I was born in July 8th in 2002 in Seoul, South Korea. My korean name is Geon Hwangbo. I have a small family with my dad, mom and older brother. When I was in kindergarden, I learned how to play soccer and swimming, so I started have interest in it. I went to the elementary school called Seoul Jamsil Elementary school. I was one of the shortest kid in the classroom. After school, I liked to play with my friends. I usually played in the playground or played soccer. When I graduated elementary school, I came to America. I went to Victor Valley Christian School which was in Victor Valley. When I finished the middle school, I came to Damien.</h2>
