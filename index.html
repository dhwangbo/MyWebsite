	<h2>Hi!!! Welcome to my website. This website is where you learn about me and see portfolios of projects that I have done. I'm currently in Junior class in Damien High School. My nationality is Korean and I came to U.S.A when I graduated my elementary school in Seoul, Korea. I like to play sports especially soccer, basketball and swimming. When I have a spare time, I like to listen to music or watch youtube or sleep.</h2>
